> Trading bots can lose money. Everything here is for **educational purposes only** and is **not financial advice**. Automated trading involves substantial risk, including the **total and rapid loss of capital**; leveraged and derivatives products can lose more than your deposit. Backtested or past performance does **not** predict future results, and live results routinely differ from simulations because of slippage, fees, latency, and market regime shifts. Always **paper-trade first**, start with capital you can afford to lose, read each project's own disclaimer and license, and comply with the laws, tax rules, and platform terms in your jurisdiction. Nothing here is an endorsement of any project, exchange, or strategy.

## What makes a good trading bot?

Before you pick a framework, know what separates a toy from a production system. Use this as a checklist when evaluating any project on this list:

- **Backtesting that matches live** — same code path for simulation and live, realistic fills, fees, and slippage. Beware look-ahead bias and survivorship bias.
- **Risk management first** — position sizing, max drawdown limits, per-trade and per-day loss caps, and a working kill switch.
- **Reliable execution** — idempotent orders, reconnection logic, rate-limit handling, and reconciliation between bot state and exchange state.
- **Observability** — structured logs, metrics, and alerts (Telegram/Discord/email) so you know when something breaks at 3 a.m.
- **Secrets hygiene** — API keys with the *minimum* permissions (never enable withdrawals), IP allow-lists, and no keys in source control.
- **Active maintenance** — recent commits, responsive issues, and a real community. A stale bot against a live market is a liability.

A typical bot wires these layers together: **data feed -> signal/strategy -> risk & sizing -> execution/router -> exchange/broker**, with **backtesting** running the exact same strategy code against historical data and **analytics** measuring the results.

### FAQ

**Is this financial advice?** No. See the [Disclaimer](#disclaimer). This is an educational reference list only.

**How do you decide what gets listed?** Projects should be open-source, reasonably maintained, and clearly described. We favour breadth across asset classes and infrastructure over a single ecosystem.

**A project here is archived or unmaintained — why list it?** Some classics (e.g. Gekko) are still excellent for learning even when archived. Where relevant we note this; open a PR if something should be flagged or removed.

**Can I add my own bot?** Yes — open a PR or use the [Add a project](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/add_project.yml) issue template. Self-submissions are welcome if they meet the bar.
